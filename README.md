## Intelligent Vehicle Damage Assessment &amp; Cost Estimator for Insurance Companies


At present, under the guidance of the new generation of information technology, the rapid accumulation of data, the continuous improvement of computing power, the continuous optimization of algorithm models, and the rapid rise of multi-scene applications have made profound changes in the development environment of artificial intelligence. In this paper, based on the demand of automobile insurance claims and intelligent transportation, combined with abundant basic data and advanced machine vision algorithm, an intelligent damage determination system of ‘Artificial Intelligence + Vehicle Insurance’ is constructed. This paper first introduces the functions of the intelligent damage assessment system. Secondly, it discusses the realization path of each functional module in detail, and finally puts forward the vision for the future.
